    "For The Image segmentation, the first architecture that was used was [U-net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597). Since segmentation is done without fully connected layers, images of multiple sizes can be fed to the network as long as the network was trained on larger images. Because the networks have flexible inputs, I started training the networks with images of size 2048 x 1152 since they were the most popular size in my data set. Training the network on images of this size was problematic because the number of parameters created due to using images of this size was very large and in order to fit the model and one image to train on in to RAM, the depth of the convolutional layers used was significantly less than the paper linked above used. Due to the shallowness of the convolutional layers, the model was not able to learn that well and only resulted in accuracies of about 88%. In order to get the batch size up and number of parameters in the model down, the training images where then cropped to sizes of 256 x 256 and the model was built around that input and output sizes. Some outputs of the smaller network can be seen below.\n",
